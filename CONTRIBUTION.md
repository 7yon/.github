# Contribution Guide

## Intro

Unlike most contribtion guides this one is not about THIS repo! It's about how you can contribute in general to the Backbase Open Source Community.

You can read more about our principles and culture of inner sourcing at our [engineering blog] (https://engineering.backbase.com/principles/).

### Community Product Extentions

Are repo that are to be reused across multiple projects to accellerate the customer but are not offically supported by Backbase.
