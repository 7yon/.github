# Contribution Guide

Unlike most contribtion guides this one is not about THIS repo! It's about how you can contribute in general to the Backbase Open Source Community.

Our goal at backbase is allow everyone to share and benefit plus accelerate from our community of engineers. You can read more about our principles and culture of inner sourcing at our [engineering blog] (https://engineering.backbase.com/principles/). That's about how we work within Backbase, but these principles translate to how as much as posible we would like to share openly and use our Backbase Github as the one place you can find open source code.
